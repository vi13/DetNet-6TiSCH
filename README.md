# DetNet-6TiSCH

Experiments and models for deterministic networking in low-power wireless IoT, focusing on IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH / 6TiSCH in the context of DetNet (latency, reliability, interference).

This repository also serves as a collection of code and experiment setups accompanying our research papers.  
Individual subfolders (e.g., `ICC26/`, â€¦) contain the corresponding models, scenarios, and evaluation scripts used in each publication.
